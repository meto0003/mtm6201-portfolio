<h1> Can Meto - Portfolio </h1>
------------------
<h2> A brief description.. </h2>
<p> This was a fun learning experience for me. I was initially excited to replicate my mockup but as I continously examined it, I decided that I wanted to keep the main points but change the style. I decided to go with a more mature and clean look. This current look of my portfolio is ideal to me and will continue to grow and evolve as I keep adding more content and pages. The shift in style also allowes me to have two different types of content that I can show future employers. I have used my own photos for the header section which in the previous version, I did not have. I think adding these and sticking to the current colors do compliment my photograpy work. 

<h2>Some of the challenges I have faced </h2> 
<p> was, once I have started using Bootstrap, as much as it is an amazing tool, It has limited some of my actions. This means, some things did not seem to be compatible and I had to do most things in their way once I decided to use it. This was of course something I have invisioned and I wanted to gain more experience with this library since It seems to be commonly used in the industry. There was definetly a learning curve and getting used to but at the end I am happy about where this is heading. </p>
